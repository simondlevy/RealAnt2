## Motivation

As fans of the new
<a href="https://www.inceptivemind.com/open-source-low-cost-realant-robot-learns-reinforcement-learning/16926/">RealAnt</a>
reinforcement learning platform, we were looking for a way to control the RealAnt wirelessly.  Thanks to the built-in
Bluetooth chip on the Raspberry Pi, this proved to be straightforward.  The steps below will walk you through what
you need to do to set this up.

## Future work

Currently our Bluetooth connection is one-way, sending command to the RealAnt but not retrieving any
telemetry data (postion, orientation, etc.)  In future work we plan to add this capability.
